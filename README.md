# ROPUGE BATORU
### A terminal based RPG made in Python

## Introduction
It's just a little project I made for fun, using only Python and the terminal. The code can be a bit better and more optimized, but I think it's okay for now.

## How it works ?
The goal is simply to get the best score. You first choose a character which will have to survive as many waves of ennemies as possible. If he gets enough XP by killing them, he can level up and get an upgrade on one of his stat, and if his level is a multiple of 5, you can add another character to your team. The more wave, the stronger the ennemies get, and if you are good enough, you can fight Neramawa at wave 100 !

## How to launch it ? 
### Windows
Download the .exe file. Then, just double-click it.
### MacOS
You can't, I don't have a mac, and creating a virtual machine of this OS is hard, thanks Apple.
### Linux
Download the .elf file. Then, open the terminal on the same directory as the file, and open it by just typing the name of the file (e.g. ./ROPUGE BATORU).
